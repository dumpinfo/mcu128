Installing AVR Studio 4.09 and USB setup
----------------------------------------

Note: Do not turn on the USB-connection to ICE40/50 or JTAGICE mkII before all software is installed.


Before installing version 4.09 we recommend that version 4.08 and 4.08 SP1 are uninstalled.  
It is important that you uninstall 4.08 before 4.08 SP1.

If 4.08 and 4.08 SP1 are not uninstalled before installing 4.09, everything will work fine, but 4.08 SP1 will still
exist in Add/Remove Programs.  If it is removed later, 4.09 need to run setup with repair to work properly.

After running USB-setup, we recommend to reboot the computer. For Windows 98, Me and 2000 the device is 
automatically installed when the ICE is turned on.  For Windows XP, you must select Automatic Installation (default) 



Special considirations
----------------------

*If SP1 is uninstalled first, 4.08 may report an error when being uninstalled.
To fix this, Restart AVR Studio 4 setup and run repair before uninstall.

*During installation you might get messages telling you the installer is trying to access files protected by windows.  
Ignore these and press Ok.  This may occur on Windows XP.

*If USB-setup was run on version 4.08 to support ICE50/40 there is no need to run it again.
Doing this however does not harm the installation.

*We strongly recomend to install the Microsoft XML Parser (MSXML) 3.0 Service Pack 4 or later (SP4).  
AVR Studio 4 uses the XML parser extensively. This package can be downloaded from the following site: 

The Microsoft® XML Parser (MSXML) 3.0 SP4

Upgrading the parser may fix the issue with only one part selectable.
